One for the money and the free rides,
it's two for the lies that you denied.
All rise, all rise.
Three for the calls you've been making,
it's four for the times you've been faking.
All rise, all rise.


This is ten percent of luck,
twenty percent of skill,
fifteen percent concentrated power of will,
five percent pleasure,
fifty percent pain,
and a hundred percent reason to remember the name!

Say you say me,
say it for always,
that's the way it should be.
Say you say me,
say it together,
natually.

I had dream, I had a aweson dream.
People in the park playing games in the dark.
And what the played was a masquerade.
Form behind the wall of doubt, a voice is crying out.
